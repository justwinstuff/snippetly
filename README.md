  <h3>Never write the same code twice.</h3>
  <p>Snippetly fetches code snippets from this repository and displays them in a clean, searchable interface. It helps developers share commonly used code patterns.</p>

## Why Snippetly?

Every developer has written the same piece of sh\*t multiple times. Snippetly exists to solve that problem by providing an organized and searchable collection of useful (not that true) code snippets.

## How to Add a Snippet

First off, thanks for contributing! **Start by forking this repository.**

### 1. Add a File

Snippets are stored in Markdown files inside a directory for their respective programming language.

- Navigate to the relevant language directory (or create one if it doesnâ€™t exist).
- Add a new Markdown file following the format outlined [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justwinstuff/snippetly/refs/heads/main/format.md).
- Give your snippet a **descriptive title** and a **clear, concise description** to help others understand its purpose.

### 2. Make a Pull Request

Once your snippet is ready, submit a pull request. A maintainer will review and merge it.

### Clear Cache

If your Pull Request was merged but the snippet is still not appearing on the website, you may need to clear your browser's cache.

**Chromium-based browsers**  
Press `CTRL + SHIFT + I` to open DevTools, navigate to the **Application** tab, go to **Local Storage**, and delete the relevant keys.

**Firefox-based browsers**  
Press `CTRL + SHIFT + I` to open DevTools, go to the **Storage** tab, select **Local Storage**, and remove the relevant keys.
